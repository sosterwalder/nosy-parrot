Introduction
************

Parrots tend to be nosy (curious). Nosy parrot is a survey system
which enables users to create surveys and let other users complete surveys while
being user friendly.

Requirements

Project vision
==============

.. What shall be accomplished? Why is it valuable? Success criteria.

.. What

Nosy parrot provides users with an easy way to create and use surveys.
Each survey contains one or more questions which can be answered. Questions
can come in different types such as open questions, ratings or closed
questions.

.. Value

Nosy parrot is valuable due to its modularity and simplicity. The modularity
allows to create any kind of surveys which allows nosy parrot to be used in
any sector (e.g. the academic or health sector).

.. Success criteria.

Nosy parrot will be deployed in multiple stages with increasing measures of
success at each stage.

In the first stage, nosy parrot will be deployed as an internal
proof-of-concept and be used to rate internal events. It is successful if the
response of the users is positive.

In the second stage, nosy parrot will be made available for free use as a
beta version. It is successful if at least 1000 users use it on a regular
basis for real-world surveys within six months.

.. TODO: Paid version as stage?

Actors
======

From the above described vision the following actors are derived.

* Guests

  As the name indicates, guests are simple visitors of the page, that are not (yet)
  registered. Guests may access publicly available surveys or surveys they have
  got a link to.

* Users

  Guests that register themselves are users. Users manage their surveys (they
  create, edit and delete surveys). Users can also complete surveys.
  
  Users can share surveys. A survey can either be made public, then it is
  available to everyone including guests, or it can be shared with specific
  other users. In addition a user can generate a link per survey which makes
  the survey available to everyone in possession of this link.

* Administrators

  TBD.

Use Cases
=========

To ensure that the project's vision is reached, use cases are
defined. The use cases define the requirements of the project in form of text
stories.
